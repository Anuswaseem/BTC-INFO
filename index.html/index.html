<h3>U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Discussion</h3>
There was a roundtable in Washington, D.C. on September 16, 2025 with crypto execs (Michael Saylor, Fred Thiel, etc.) and lawmakers (Senator Cynthia Lummis, Rep. Nick Begich). They discussed supporting a bill to create a federal strategic reserve of Bitcoin, possibly acquiring up to 1 million BTC over 5 years, without affecting the federal budget.

<h3>Steady Price Pattern & Halvin Cycle Speculationg</h3>  
Analysts note Bitcoin‚Äôs unusually steady upward movement recently. With the halving cycle (which reduces BTC issuance roughly every 4 years) in view, some believe that historical patterns suggest a price peak might occur late September or early October 2025. But there are caveats: dynamics may have shifted this cycle compared to prior ones.
